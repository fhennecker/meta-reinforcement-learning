\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty} 

\noindent I would first like to thank professor Peter Vrancx for accepting
to lead me into the exciting field of reinforcement learning, and for finding
a topic that was so close to what I wanted to explore while at the same
time being at the bleeding edge of research. Throughout the project, he
supported me by suggesting key ideas and insights while letting me explore
and understand the very particular topic of meta-learning on my own. He
gave me full responsibility of my work and I am very grateful for his way 
of directing me.\\

I must obviously give my father the credit he deserves for accepting, without
one single hesitation, to read this work in full to then explain it to me,
greatly helping me adjust the scope of some sections, but also pointing out
unclear or missing parts.\\

My girlfriend also had the chance to advise me on the first drafts of this 
thesis, but she had to bear the burden of listening to my rambles at
the most barren points of my research too. Long days of trying to make something
work without success would have probably discouraged me if she wasn't there
to support me.\\

I could not talk about complaining without mentioning my friends who lived the
same experience at the same time. Such an experience is much easier when not
alone, and exchanging tips and ideas while at the same time lauging about
our fates greatly helped me throughout the process.\\

Last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank my professors at the
University of Southampton, where I spent one fruitful year, 
for introducing me to the field of artificial
intelligence with such passion, and perhaps more specifically professor
Mahesan Niranjan who was the first to chat with me about reinforcement learning,
spurring my interest in this exciting domain.
